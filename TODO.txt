Task 1: done

Task 2: done

Task 4: to start the implementation of the matrix_dense

Task 5: to get rid of old tmp stuff

Task 6: done

Task 7: to put some more examples for matrix_dense

Task 8: to write matrix_dense unit tests

Task 9: to make a base class common to matrix_dense and vector_dense

Task 10: to clean up all the unit tests and the examples

Task 11: to write some benchmarks for vector_dense and matrix_dense

Task 13: renaming vector_dense<T> to dense_vector<T>. same for matrix_dense<T> to dense_matrix<T>

Task 14: to make dense_matrix<T> class to use the dense_container_class<T>

Task 15: to add some valgrind test for dense_matrix<T>

Task 16: To fix the ambiguity of constructors (uint64_t, uint64_t, uint64_t = 0)
         and (uint64_t, uint64_t)

Task 18: to make units tests to comply with the new simplified constructors

Task 19: To improve unit tests for dense_matrix<T>

Task 3: to finish the implementation of the DSYEVX and DSYEVR

Task 12: to make the dense container base class with protected attribute 
         to avoid using the dense_container directly

Task 17: to improve the performance of the functions 'set', '='
         to make them comparable to a element by element set and assignment

Task 20: To fix the DSYEVR and DSYEVX examples and wrappers
