Task 1: done

Task 2: done

Task 4: to start the implementation of the matrix_dense

Task 5: to get rid of old tmp stuff

Task 6: done

Task 7: to put some more examples for matrix_dense

Task 8: to write matrix_dense unit tests

Task 9: to make a base class common to matrix_dense and vector_dense

Task 10: to clean up all the unit tests and the examples

Task 11: to write some benchmarks for vector_dense and matrix_dense

Task 13: renaming vector_dense<T> to dense_vector<T>. same for matrix_dense<T> to dense_matrix<T>

Task 14: to make dense_matrix<T> class to use the dense_container_class<T>

Task 15: to add some valgrind test for dense_matrix<T>

Task 16: To fix the ambiguity of constructors (uint64_t, uint64_t, uint64_t = 0)
         and (uint64_t, uint64_t)

Task 18: to make units tests to comply with the new simplified constructors

Task 19: To improve unit tests for dense_matrix<T>

Task 23: to finish the implementation of Dot for all the rest types: single precision, 
         complex 8, complex 16

Task 24: to simplify the use of namespace and to put Eigensystem in the sepolia namespace

Task 27: to finish the implementation of Transpose for all the rest types:  
         complex 8,  complex 16.
         Need to see how can I use blas interfaces instead of MKL

Task 3: to finish the implementation of the DSYEVX and DSYEVR

Task 12: to make the dense container base class with protected attribute 
         to avoid using the dense_container directly

Task 17: to improve the performance of the functions 'set', '='
         to make them comparable to a element by element set and assignment

Task 20: To fix the DSYEVR and DSYEVX examples and wrappers

Task 21: to parallelize the equal function of the dense_container

Task 25: to build the sepolia3 library and to install + the headers in a visible location

Task 26: to simplify the use of examples/unit_tests/benchmarks
         by running them using a make command

Task 22: to remove the NT1D OpenMP parameter and to set the number of threads dynamically
